        <h3>Plato’s Account of the Nature of Knowledge</h3>
        <h5><em>By Jonathan Pulsipher</em></h5>
        <p>
            Plato has a powerful argument for obtaining knowledge through an understanding of forms. Mathematics constitutes the basis of his argument. However, this overreliance on mathematics creates critical flaws in his argument, undermining the effectiveness of using forms to gain knowledge. I will first explain Plato’s epistemological argument for forms as a method of truth-seeking, then show how his use of math does not, in reality, lead to a conclusion of universal forms. Once we see that his argument cannot prove the reality of forms, we conclude that it is not a reliable method for obtaining truth.
        </p>    
        <p>    
            Plato’s argument for seeking knowledge through forms begins with his assertions that “knowledge” is believing through reason in something that is actually true, while “opinion” is any belief in something false or in something true, but without the necessary trial of reason (Melchert 120). This is a high standard for knowledge, because it’s difficult to be certain that one’s belief is actually true. Plato’s response to this concern is that math is something we can know (121). We can understand mathematical principles and, once understood, they will “stay put”—no one will be able to persuade us otherwise (120). He argues that this knowledge comes from our reasoning about forms and not from our senses (123). For example, we can never encounter with our senses a square with perfect proportions; rather, every square we create or measure is simply a representation of the ideal square. Thus, our knowledge that a certain imperfect object is a square comes from understanding the form of a square (121). According to Plato, all of our understanding of math comes in this manner: conceptualizing and reasoning about mathematical forms, not physical examples. Everything in the world—both physical and non-physical—has a perfect form, just like all squares have the form of the perfect square. A form, by definition, is not specific to one particular object, but describes a whole group of similar objects. Thus, for Plato, knowledge is reasoning out forms, unchanging and permanent truths in an ever-changing world (123).
        </p>    
        <p>    
            Though powerful, Plato’s philosophy runs into a problem because math cannot be extrapolated to other forms. Math is a human construct for understanding the world. It is naturally already in forms. We understand a square as a form and then add dimensions to it. This is not the same as morality. Morality, courage, and similar concepts do not have unchanging forms, because they are contingent upon the conditions of the physical world. We cannot, for example, define “perfect courage” as simply as a mathematical formula. It is just what one might feel in a battle or similar situation. The definite world of mathematics doesn’t directly link to more abstract ideas, like courage or morality. Thus, while math may be understood through forms, it doesn’t intrinsically follow that other things can be understood this way as well.
        </p>    
        <p>    
            The contradictions that arise from adding more forms further promotes that math cannot justify the reality of the other forms. Math works as a cohesive whole and doesn’t self-contradict, the existence of a square doesn’t contradict the existence of a circle. Similarly, since all of Plato’s forms (including those that describe non-physical ideas) are parts of the “form of the good” (132), they shouldn’t contradict each other. But one can conceive of times where a contradiction does occur. While Plato only explains so many forms—and even then rarely in concrete terms—we can reason that the form of piety in Euthyphro includes respect for one’s parents by the reaction Socrates has when he hears that Euthyphro is accusing his own father (75). Drawing from Confucian philosophy this respect would include taking care of one’s parents, especially when they are no longer able to care for themselves. Utilizing this definition, if a person was in poverty and unable to provide for one’s parents, it seems that to act in line with the form of piety would entail stealing food for them. But as Socrates has pointed out in Crito in order to follow the form of “the good life”, one must never disobey the laws of the city (108-110). But to not steal and live in accord with the form of “the good life” would be to act contrary to the form of piety, causing one’s parents to starve. Plato doesn’t offer a way to hierarch the forms, because they aren’t supposed to contradict. This is a major flaw for his philosophy, because the world isn’t as ideal as his perception of the forms conclude.
        </p>    
        <p>    
            Some may argue that I formed the contradiction by looking to Confucian philosophy. That may be true, but it provides a positive account of this form of piety, while Plato’s is merely negative. Many of his dialogues end without a final decision, because there is no final form that can be described without contradicting other forms at different points. His account cannot find the full consistency that Plato searches for in his conception of the forms.
        </p>    
        <p>    
            Plato’s account attempts to prove the unprovable. We will never be able to reach a theory that embraces everything in absolute, mathematical terms. There will always be a degree of skepticism, which requires a philosophy that is less demanding in defining knowledge. Plato’s demands for knowledge forces him into a world of absolutes. He doesn’t account enough for the world of sense. This is why the forms can’t explain reality. Plato’s account attempts to ignore the basis for most knowledge, and thus is ultimately unsatisfactory as a method to obtain truth. A more adequate account is a healthy combination of skepticism and Plato’s absolutism.
