        <h3>A Skeptic Critique of Aristotle’s Account of Truth</h3>
        <h5><em>By Jonathan Pulsipher</em></h5>
        <p>
            For centuries Aristotelian logic has been the basis of argumentation, only recently has it been abridged with technical additions (Melchert 158). Aristotle’s powerful account describes how truth can be understood through reasons or arguments, but his theory makes assumptions that the Skeptics demonstrate are unprovable. Because of their ability to identify such flaws across philosophy, the Skeptics make a vital contribution to truth. However, I will show that their philosophy doesn’t inherently discredit all other philosophies, it merely denounces dogmatism. Thus, I believe that Aristotle’s philosophy with the Skeptic’s elimination of dogmatism gives the most likely account of truth.
        </p> 
        <p>    
            Aristotle’s approach to truth is two-pronged. First, he believes that statements are true only if they are in accordance with reality, regardless of an individual’s perception (161). Second, he considers a person to be wise only if he/she knows the cause of that truth (162). He attempts to establish reasons or causes of truth through good arguments (162). A good argument for Aristotle comes in the form of syllogisms. Syllogisms are a series of three statements where the first two–the premises–prove the third–the conclusion (163). In order for the syllogism to be good, the premises–if true–must guarantee the conclusion. Though this doesn’t prove that a statement is inherently true, it does guarantee that there isn’t a logical fallacy in the form itself. As long as the form is correct, all that remains to be evaluated for the truth of a conclusion is the truth of the premises. This requires another two syllogisms with each of the premises as the conclusion of their respective syllogism. But, as may become apparent, this proof for truth would only create an infinite string of proofs proving the premises of each preceding proof. Because of this, Aristotle asserts that there are first principles, axioms that don’t require prior premises to prove that they are true. They must be truths that we are more certain of than all that comes after them (165). The way we identify these principles is through induction from the world around us through our sense experience (166). This is Aristotle’s strategy for defining truth.
        </p> 
        <p>     
            The Skeptics, on the other hand, look to senses as a reason for why knowledge is indeterminable, ultimately building their case for why dogmatism in philosophy is misguided. For the Skeptic, the diversity of senses among animals and preference of senses among humans demonstrate that knowledge cannot be determined—any measurement would value one’s preference of sense over another’s (210). But more powerfully, the Skeptic shows that every philosophy falters when considered in the light of the fallacies of infinite regress or circular reasoning (211). These two fallacies undermine any ability to establish a criterion to for a philosophy. An argument for a criterion will require another criterion to evaluate its effectiveness. That new criterion will require another onto infinity, thus falling into what is called an infinite regress. Or, the argument will eventually use the original criterion to justify a later one, thus becoming what is called circular reasoning (212). 
        </p> 
        <p>        
            A Skeptic would be quick to point out that though Aristotle evades infinite regress with his first principles (axioms), his account for truth falls to circular reasoning. Aristotle attempts to explain the world of the senses through the assertion of axioms that can only be understood from our sense experience (166). Essentially, he tries to understand the world around us based on an understanding of that same world. Thus, he brings his account in a full circle. His account of the first principles is therefore unsatisfactory: these axioms are unprovable. Skepticism can push all philosophies to the point that they break in similar ways. 
        </p> 
        <p>     
            The primary objection to skepticism is that it undermines all knowledge and puts no limits on our behavior. Skepticism seems to suggest that, if we cannot logically prove truth, then there is no truth. Why then should we stop people from breaking the law or even committing crimes against humanity, if we are unable to prove that their actions are wrong? This is an intuitive response to the Skeptic’s arguments. However, skepticism doesn’t necessarily lead to the radicalism expressed in those concerns. Many skeptics decide to make choices on what appears to be good or needed, suspending any judgement on what is undeniably right or wrong (213). Their philosophy is one that is not committed or determined to anything in particular, yet not paralyzed by this lack of commitment. Furthermore, I posit that skepticism doesn’t have to reject Aristotle entirely. Skepticism is mostly an awareness that dogmatism is unwarranted. In other words, no philosophy is so strong that it can’t be questioned on its most fundamental level. But, because we have to make decisions, we should try to live in accordance with what appears to be best. Aristotle’s philosophy is a powerful way to determine—through reasoning—what appears to be the best. There may be no possibility of verifying that our convictions are in accordance with reality, but we can verify that they are in accordance with the best appearance of reality. Thus, Skepticism and Aristotelian logic complement each other.
        </p> 
        <p>     
            If truth requires stating things as they really are, as Aristotle argues, then the Skeptics have thoroughly shown that we will never be able to identify it. However, if we alter Aristotle's definition of truth to be stating what is in best appearance with reality, then Aristotle’s philosophy still contains important methods for finding truth.
