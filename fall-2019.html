        <h3>Kafka and Libertarianism</h3>
        <h5><em>By Jonathan Pulsipher</em></h5>
        <p>
            Kafka’s The Trial depicts a morbid dystopia that results from a dysfunctional and estranged bureaucracy. Michael Löwy outlines how this story is an expression of Kafka’s Libertarian sympathies. I will detail Löwy’s argument. I will then analyze some libertarianism with an understanding founded upon John Locke. I will proceed to argue that Löwy’s libertarian interpretation of The Trial is unfounded and that Kafka is merely critiquing bureaucracy.
        </p> 
        <p>   
            Michael Löwy demonstrates that in The Trial Kafka depicts a state that “crushes, suffocates, or kills individuals” (Löwy 10). He argues that this negative outlook does not apply solely to authoritarian regimes, since the world that the main character, Joseph K., lives in has a “legal constitution” (10). Even in this theoretically liberal society, K. is crushed and suffocated by the continuous trial that looms over his head. Over the months this eventually drives him to think less rationally and be far more impetuous. The state eventually kills K.. It becomes apparent that the state oppresses individuals by not seeking justice but rather hunting for victims. Löwy demonstrates this by highlighting the portrait that the artist Titorelli paints of the judge. Rather than depicting the judge in the image of the Goddess of Justice, he is riddled with symbols alluding to the Goddess of the hunt (11). Thus, depicting the bureaucracy in the legal system to be far less concerned with justice than seeking ways of power and oppression.
        </p>    
        <p> 
            Löwy argues that the libertarian argument is furthered when Kafka demonstrates that the bureaucracy justifies its actions through the alleged necessity of its position. This is demonstrated in the dialogue that K. has with the priest. The two discuss an analogy of a guardian at a door. The guardian is akin to the bureaucracy of the court. The door symbolizes the decision that they prolong making. The priest—an employee of the court—declares that the guardian and its lies are “accepted as necessary” (10). As Hannah Arendt argues, this reveals “the sacred theology and innermost conviction of bureaucrats to be a belief in necessity for its own sake” (10). Löwy’s conclusion is that Kafka wishes for an abolition of bureaucracy.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Löwy’s depiction of Kafka has a lot of weight. Kafka seems to persuade the reader to share such anti-bureaucratic sympathies by continuously depicting the ordeal of the trial as both absurd and extensive. It becomes painfully absurd as K. continuously encounters higher officials that don’t know what he is being tried for. The reader never learns what the trial is for and why it necessitates death. Neither does K. The absurdity is carried into the understanding that acquittal is a myth and that the only course of action left to K. is to either continuously postpone the trial or to suffer through short sessions of convincing the judge of his good character until another judge decides to reinitiate the trial (Kafka 147-151). Thus, it appears that Kafka is advocating for a libertarian world that minimizes the size of the bureaucracy rather than having the massive, oppressive, and inefficient system that exists in the top floors of most buildings in K.’s world. But this implants a view on Kafka’s work that he would not necessarily accept. For further discussion a description of Libertarianism would be fruitful.
        </p>    
        <p>
            Libertarianism argues for a minimalist state. Many look to John Locke as one of the originators of libertarianism. Whether he would accept the claim is still debated, but his contribution to this modern philosophy is undisputable. Locke founded his conceptualization of rights on the understanding that all individuals own themselves. They own themselves and therefore their labor. Everything originated in common. But when an individual mixes their labor with an item, it is mixed with something they own. Therefore, they begin to own the item. This is the beginning of the right to property. The belief that we own ourselves also develops the right to life and liberty. Life, because it is wrong to harm something that is not yours and liberty because we can do what we will with what we own. The right to property, life and liberty all existed in a state of nature. But individuals find that all their rights are strengthened and better protected by entering into a social contract. While Locke’s account can be used for various political positions, libertarians argue that the contract should solely protect the fundamental rights. The sole purpose of laws is to protect individuals from infringements on their rights.
        </p>    
        <p>
            While the justification for libertarianism is well developed, the premise of individual ownership is ultimately flawed. If individual ownership was true and everyone owned the product of their labor, then mothers should own the children they bear. The baby’s development in the womb and birth both require massive amounts of physical labor from the mother. Because her labor produces the child, it should be entirely hers. If the child is owned by another, then how does it come to own itself? Individual ownership cannot pass from generation to generation. Thus, the origination of individual ownership can neither be identified nor justified. These are the reasons that libertarianism in general is not a grounded philosophy.
        </p>    
        <p>
            It may be argued that the individual owns herself because she has a will and can think independently. She has the capacity to make autonomous decisions and this thereby grants her possession of her body (the thing that no one else controls as greatly as she does). But this account would be to deconstruct the notion of the origination of property as something that one mixes one’s labor with. After such a violation of this understanding, what reason is there to demand that property is the best way to understand the world? Rather than force this view of property, it would be better to understand the world less individualistically. Everyone needs other people. People require relationships and interactions with others to identify who they are. People are social creatures and to estrange them from society would be to take away their identity. Thus, rather than this rights and individual focus, it would be better to understand how to strengthen the community as a whole.
        </p>    
        <p>
            But this understanding of property and the accompanying critique don’t fully address Kafka’s depiction. His story has little to do with rights. Despite there being a constitution, K. never considers the notion of rights and particularly any violation in that regard. Rather the book focuses on the size, secrecy, corruption and inefficiency of the system. Thus, Kafka clearly is critiquing bureaucracy, but his book does not necessitate the abolition of it. Efforts to improve the transparency of bureaucracy would solve the problems attached to secrecy and corruption. Efforts to improve efficiency would simultaneously decrease the size. These solutions are not libertarian. They are not founded on rights or attached to an understanding of property. But, Kafka’s critique is satisfied by them.
        </p>    
        <p>
            In conclusion, Kafka’s The Trial is undoubtedly a critique on bureaucracy, but does not necessarily require a libertarian solution. The lack of dialogue on rights and property demonstrates that Kafka is neither restricted to a libertarian world view, nor that he endorses such a view.
